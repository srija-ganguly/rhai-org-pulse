# Agent Conventions

Vendor-neutral conventions for AI agents working on this codebase. Tool-specific
configuration (e.g., `.claude/CLAUDE.md`) should import this file rather than
duplicating these conventions.

## Project Overview

**Org Pulse** — a modular engineering dashboard connecting Jira, GitHub, and
GitLab data with a team roster to surface delivery insights. Vue 3 + Express,
deployed on OpenShift via ArgoCD.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 SPA (`<script setup>`), Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 3, Chart.js 4
- **Backend**: Express (port 3001), single `server/dev-server.js` for dev + prod
- **Modules**: Built-in modules in `modules/<slug>/` with `module.json` manifests, auto-discovered
- **Auth**: OpenShift OAuth proxy in prod; no auth locally (uses `ADMIN_EMAILS`)
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (`./data/`), mounted as PVC in OpenShift
- **Shared code**: `shared/client/` and `shared/server/`, importable via `@shared` alias

See `docs/MODULES.md` for the module development guide.

## Hard Constraints

These are non-negotiable. Every PR should be checked against them.

### 1. No cross-module imports

Modules import only from `@shared`. Cross-module data access goes through
`readFromStorage()` for files listed in another module's `module.json > export.files`,
or through API calls at `/api/modules/<slug>/`. Never import directly from
another module's directory. See `shared/API.md` for the stability contract.

### 2. Use storage abstractions for all data

Always use `readFromStorage` / `writeToStorage` for data files. Never construct
raw filesystem paths. These abstractions handle demo mode, path-traversal safety,
and the PVC mount.

### 3. The app is a display layer, not a compute engine

If something requires significant computation — complex aggregations across
hundreds of Jira issues, ML scoring, data enrichment, bulk cross-referencing —
it belongs in an external process (CI pipeline, GitLab job, scheduled task)
that pushes pre-computed results into the app. The app backend should do
lightweight fetching, caching, and serving. The releases module's execution
pipeline (GitLab CI artifact fetch) and AI Impact assessments are good
examples of this pattern: external pipelines push data via the bulk API
endpoints.

### 4. New pages go in existing modules when the domain overlaps

Only create a new module when it has a genuinely distinct domain with no
conceptual home in an existing module. If a feature is a new way to look at
data that relates to an existing module's purpose, add it as a view there.
Current modules: ai-impact, releases, system-health, team-tracker,
upstream-pulse.

### 5. No TypeScript

Plain JavaScript throughout. CommonJS (`require`) for server-side code, ES
modules (`import`) for frontend code.

### 6. API routes require OpenAPI annotations

Every new or modified Express route handler must have an `@openapi` JSDoc
annotation. CI enforces a minimum operation count via `validate:openapi`.

### 7. Keep documentation in sync

Documentation changes must land in the same PR as the code they describe:

- **Data format changes** → update `docs/DATA-FORMATS.md` and `fixtures/`
- **New shared exports** → update `shared/API.md`
- **Module system changes** → update `docs/MODULES.md`
- **Node.js version changes** → update `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to match `package.json` engines field
- **npm scripts or Makefile commands** (additions, removals, or changes) → update Commands section in `README.md`
- **Testing stack changes** (test frameworks added/removed from `package.json` devDependencies, test types added/removed from `tests/`, or test-related scripts/Makefile targets added/removed/changed) → update `README.md` (Tech Stack), `docs/MODULES.md` (Testing), and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Testing)

### 8. Module code must not read secrets from `process.env`

Declare secrets in `module.json` under `secrets` and read them from
`context.secrets` or `context.resolveSecret()`. Use shared client factories
(`createJiraClient`, etc.) with credentials from `context.secrets`. An ESLint
rule (`no-module-process-env`) enforces this — CI will reject violations.
Non-secret config (e.g. `JIRA_HOST`, `DEMO_MODE`) is exempt. See
`docs/MODULES.md` for the secrets guide.

## Code Style

- `<script setup>` for Vue components
- Tailwind CSS utility classes; custom `primary` palette in `tailwind.config.mjs`
- Composables for shared state logic (`shared/client/composables/`)
- Always run `npm run lint` before committing — CI rejects lint failures
- A pre-commit hook (`lint-staged` + `husky`) auto-runs ESLint on staged files

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Vitest + @vue/test-utils for frontend, Vitest for backend
- **Smoke tests**: Playwright against production containers (verify app loads)
- **Integration tests**: Playwright module-specific tests (`make test-module MODULE=<name>`)
- **Validation**: `npm run validate:modules` for module manifests
- Run `npm test` before committing

**Integration test enforcement:** PRs that modify files in `modules/` (views, components, server routes, server logic) **require** corresponding integration test updates. This is enforced during code review. See `.github/instructions/review.instructions.md` for the full policy and exceptions.

## Code Review

Review criteria are defined in
[`.github/instructions/review.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/review.instructions.md).
All automated reviews (CI) and manual reviews (`/pr-review`) use this shared
checklist, which explicitly enforces the hard constraints above.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev:full              # Start Vite (5173) + Express (3001)
npm run dev                   # Vite only
npm run dev:server            # Express only (needs .env)
npm test                      # Run all tests
npm run test:watch            # Watch mode
npm run lint                  # Lint check
npm run build                 # Production build
npm run validate:modules      # Validate module manifests
npm run validate:openapi      # Validate OpenAPI annotations

# Container-based tests (requires Docker/Podman)
make smoke-test-core            # Run smoke tests against core images
make smoke-test                 # Run smoke tests against AI Eng images
make test-module MODULE=<name>  # Run integration tests for a module
```
